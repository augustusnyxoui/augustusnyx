                        Right now, I find myself contemplating the path ahead with a mix of excitement and uncertainty. 
                        Securing a job is certain, but different opportunities within the IT industry presents a challenge for me in 
                        identifying the most fitting role for my skills and aspirations. However, I view this uncertainty as an important part of my journey, 
                        one that will unfold as I navigate through the chapters of my career. What remains unequivocal is my desire to 
                        pursue a profession that ignites my passion and fills each day with anticipation and inspiration.

                        To my present self, I am so proud of how far you've come and I am happy that you are starting to be more true to yourself. 
                        You're still young so explore things and keep doing the things you love. Keep the passion burning for the things you love to 
                        do and most of all, work and study hard. Times may get tough but know that everyhting will pay off well in the end. Fighting!<br>

                        <b>FUTURE SELF</b><br>
                        To my future self, I don't know what you are and what you do nor I have the faintest idea whether the dreams that were once ingrained in 
                        your mind were materialized or achieved. Whatever it may be, I am proud of you and know that I am always rooting for you. You're probably 
                        not far off the distant future so I would assume you still have a lot of time but be aware that time can pass by fast with all the happy 
                        and joyous moments you encounter. With that said, do the things you want to do so in the end you won't regret anything and even if you 
                        think it's something your bound not to succeed in doing, always remember this, "Make mistakes but don't regret them, learn from them.
